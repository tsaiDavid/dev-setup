  * Similar to the OSX Desktop application, Dash - this is a free web app that allows you to store and quickly access docs for a variety of things
  
* http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/
  * Awesome site for "cheatsheets" for just about anything - from  VIM through React
  
* https://kapeli.com/dash
  * Great desktop app for keeping docs handy - works really well with Alfred (a Spotlight replacement), well worth the cost
